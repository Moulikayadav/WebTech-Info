    <h4>What is Web Design?</h4><br>
    Some consider web design as creating the appearance of a web page or an app screen. At a first glance, web designer is more concentrated on everything users actually see on their screens and less on the mechanism of making it actually work.  In fact, this is only a small part of the process standing behind the page “look”. Web design requires multiple skills and might include such disciplines as graphic design, interface design, UI and UX.
    <br><br>
    In other words, production of a website is not dependent only on a beautiful appearance. There is a myth, that designs must be original. But originality does not always mean that design would be understood properly. There are already exist settled UX rules that not worth changing. If you are not 100% sure that you innovative vision would be welcomed, better don’t implement it in your work.
    <br><br>
   <h4> What do web designers actually do?</h4><br>
Though web designers don’t mess up with back-end development, they still care about functionality.
<br><br>
By the way, UX, mentioned above, stands for user experience. UX design on its part is a process of enhancing the user experience, usability, accessibility and increasing the satisfaction while using the product as a result.
<br><br>
For example, working on UX means designer creates the convenient navigation, website structure and labeling. Making websites understandable, accessible and fine-looking at the same time is not that easy.
<br><br>
<h4>What are the stages of creating a web design?</h4><br>
Now let’s study the steps of making a website design. As an artist, web designer begins the process with making sketches. They might be either hand-drawn or digitalized in any graphics editor. First sketches give you the general understanding of what elements are planned to be placed on each page.
<br><br>
When the general conception is determined, it’s time to detail each page. Generally, the websites we create have numerous pages and multiple functions, that are all connected with each other. Therefore, the next step is creating wireframes based on the preliminary sketches.
<br><br>
Wireframes give the more accurate visualization of the page layout. Moreover, they are the skeleton for the whole project, describing the functionality, content layout and interconnections between pages and elements.
<br><br>
The final step of design is adding colors, content, typography, animations and other fancy features that will make your website outstanding.

    <h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1><br>
    <h5>
        <h4>What is Web Development?</h4><br><br>
        Web development is a broad term. It means the creation of any websites and web applications working all across the Internet (f.e. web portals for different business purposes). Both making the simple web page with plain text or building a multifunctional web application is web development.<br><br>
        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).<br>[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
<br><br>
        Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.<br>[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
    
    </h5>
<br>

<h4>What Types of Web Development Are There?</h4>
  <h5>  Back end, front end, and full stack web development are three separate career paths that can sometimes feel muddied in the technology space.<br> Put plainly, back end developers are focused on data, modeling, and the back end of a website. <br> Front end developers help build what users interact with and see. <br>A full stack developer does some or all of the above.</h5>

    <h4 id="A">  What Is a Front End Developer?</h4> 
  <h5>
    Front end development is the part of web development that codes and creates front end elements of a website, which are features that are directly viewable and accessible by the end-user or client. Essentially, a front end developer is responsible for everything you see and works to enhance the user experience to ensure it is seamless. They help create the overall design and aesthetic, in addition to debugging and using static code analysis.<br>

</h6>
<h5>
Front end developers are responsible for implementing visual components on a website as well as interactive features like navigation, buttons, or anything that enhances overall usability. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are often used to make sure the visual side (or client-side) of a site runs smoothly so that users can interact freely and comfortably with it . Although some front end developers handle web design, others work from a web designer's mock-ups.
<br>
Some of the skills required for a front end developer job include:
<ul>
    <li> A good grasp of front end programming languages.</li>
    <li> The ability to create a responsive design.</li>
    <li> A knowledge of testing and debugging.</li>
    <li> An understanding of front end development tools and features like automation, content management systems, version control systems, APIs, and frameworks.</li>
</ul>
</h5>

<h4>What Are Common Front End Development Languages?</h4>
<h5>The main front end coding languages are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Front end developers focus on grid systems and layout as well as typography and color theory, using UX/UI principles to create a seamless experience.</h5>

<h4>Front End Developer Jobs</h4>
<h5>Front end jobs range from developers who have mastered a specific coding language to those who possess a range of skills beyond the front end. Since the front end involves visual aesthetics, these jobs may also include graphic design and content. Many skills overlap between the different jobs, and specific titles may mean different things to each company.

    <h4> What Is a Back End Developer?</h4>
    <h5> Back end development is aptly named for web development that occurs at the back end of programs. In contrast to front end development, which focuses on customer-facing products and programs, back end development addresses server-side web application logic and integration. Back end developers write code to help a database and application communicate. Essentially, a back end developer handles what you don't see; they are in charge of the back end of a website, which includes servers, databases, and applications.</h5>

<ul>
    <li>Database management</li>
    <li>Framework utilization</li>
    <li>Programming</li>
    <li>Knowledge of accessibility and security compliance</li>

<h4>Back End Developer Jobs</h4>
<h5> Back end developer jobs typically require a strong knowledge of programming. Some companies look for developers who have in-depth skills with a specific language, while others may require the ability to program in multiple languages. A smaller organization may want someone who can work both the back and front end, in other words, a full stack developer.<br>

      <h4 class="card-title">Web Design</h4>
      <p class="card-text">Web design is the process of creating websites. It encompasses several different aspects, including webpage layout, content production, and graphic design. While the terms web design and web development are often used interchangeably, web design is technically a subset of the broader category of web development. <br><br> Websites are created using a markup language called HTML. Web designers build webpages using HTML tags that define the content and metadata of each page. The layout and appearance of the elements within a webpage are typically defined using CSS, or cascading style sheets. Therefore, most websites include a combination of HTML and CSS that defines how each page will appear in a browser.

      <p class="card-text">
        Web development refers to building, creating, and maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management.

     <br>  While the terms "web developer" and "web designer" are often used synonymously, they do not mean the same thing. Technically, a web designer only designs website interfaces using HTML and CSS. A web developer may be involved in designing a website, but may also write web scripts in languages such as PHP and ASP. Additionally, a web developer may help maintain and update a database used by a dynamic website.
        <br>  <br>Web development includes many types of web content creation. Some examples include hand coding web pages in a text editor, building a website in a program like Dreamweaver, and updating a blog via a blogging website. In recent years, content management systems like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla have also become popular means of web development. These tools make it easy for anyone to create and edit their own website using a web-based interface.

      <p class="card-text">A front-end developer is a programmer that codes the front end of a website. Typically, the front-end developer's job is to convert website design files into raw HTML, JavaScript (JS) and/or CSS code. This includes the basic website design/layout, images, content, buttons, navigation and internal links. The end result is code that serves as the website's front-end structure, which is used by a back-end developer to add business logics and connect databases and processes, among other processes.
     <br> <br>  A front-end developer is responsible for ensuring that a website's visual front end is free of errors and looks exactly as designed. A front-end developer also ensures that a website has the same visibility across different computing and mobile Web browsers.
        
      <br>  Similarly, in software applications, a front-end web developer creates the graphical user interface (GUI) that enables access to the software's back-end features and capabilities.

If you are interested in making things work, couldn’t care less about how they look and thrive with a puzzle to solve, you should consider becoming a back end web developer.<br>
      <br>  Client-side coding is the sole domain of front end developers. They create the structure of the web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, make transitions smooth as butter, and make buttons clickable and text fields editable.
   <br>Most common example of Backend programming is when you are reading an article on the blog. The fonts, colors, designs, etc. constitute the frontend of this page. While the content of the article is rendered from a server and fetched from a database. This is the backend part of the application.
