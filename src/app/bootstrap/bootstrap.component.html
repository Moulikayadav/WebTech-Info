                  <div class="box1"><p>Where to Get Bootstrap 4?<br>
                    There are two ways to start using Bootstrap 4 on your own web site.<br>
                    
                    You can:<br>
                    
                    Include Bootstrap 4 from a CDN<br>
                    Download Bootstrap 4 from getbootstrap.com<br>
                    Bootstrap 4 CDN<br>
                    If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap 4 yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
                    <br>
                    jsDelivr provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. You must also include jQuery:<br>
                    <img src="./assets/Images/bootstrap-cdn-min-1024x445.png" height="400px" width="900px"><br><br>
                    One advantage of using the Bootstrap 4 CDN:
<br>Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap 4 from jsDelivr when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.
<br><br>
jQuery and Popper?<br>
Bootstrap 4 use jQuery and Popper.js for JavaScript components (like modals, tooltips, popovers etc). However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need them.<br>
